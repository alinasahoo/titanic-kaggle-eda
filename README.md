# Exploratory Data Analysis - Titanic Dataset

This is just for the learning purposes. I will be working on the Titanic Dataset for predicting a classification - whether a person survived or is deceased. This is a semi-cleaned version of the dataset available in kaggle.

All the detailed explanation is within the notebook. 
Thank You. Happy Coding, Adios!
